    [GOAL: implement dogleg channer router]

    You may have to implement some functions in graph.cpp, router.h and modify some functions on some source codes.

    There are three examples in example.h.

    Your output must be as below:

    Output file name is "routing_{net_names}_{#tracks}_{#vias}_{#doglegs}.txt" on "results" directory

    Exmaple: 

        For net A, B, C and 2 tracks, 8 vias, and 1 dogleg,

        Output file name is "routing_ABC_2_8_1.txt" on "results" directory

    Output format:

        For each net,

        [net_name] [track_index]

        Index of track starts from 0 (bottom track).

        Example: 

            For net A, B, C 
            -------file begin------
            A 2
            B 1
            C 0
            -------file end--------

            If net B is broken to two nets (b1, b2) and b1 is assigned to track 1 and b2 is assigned to track 0, then,
            -------file begin------
            A 1
            B 1 0
            C 0
            -------file end--------

            The tracks for broken net must be listed leftmost one first.
